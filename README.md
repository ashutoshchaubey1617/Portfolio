# Ashutosh Chaubey | Personal Portfolio


Hi, I'm Ashutosh Chaubey, a Computer Science student at VIT Vellore (25BCE0711).

This is my personal portfolio website. I built this from scratch to document my journey in tech, showcase my projects (like VIT Collab Hub), and track my progress as I learn Full Stack Development.

I didn't want to use a generic template, so I coded this using vanilla CSS and JavaScript to get better at the fundamentals.

What's Inside?
No Frameworks: Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JS to keep it fast and lightweight.
3D Background: I used **Three.js** to create the floating particle effect in the background.
Dark Mode:A fully working theme toggler that remembers your preference.
Animations: Custom hover effects (like the glowing nav bar) and scroll animations using Intersection Observer.
Responsive: Works smoothly on mobile and desktop.

Tech Used

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
Libraries: Three.js (for the 3D background), FontAwesome (icons)
Tools: VS Code, Git
